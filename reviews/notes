Playwright @Playwright/test package:  designed specifically for end-toend testing
    Uses a specialized test runner and framwork, no need for junit/testNJ etc
Comes with buildin report
Fixtures: are set of variables that reffer to the specific type of objects (ex: in selenium we have "driver" in Playwright we have "page")
Fixtures: for (UI) page; browser; context; viewport; browserName; (API) request; baseURL..
Has its own global configuration
it includes built-in assertions
API testing
--------------------------------------------------------
test (); // the test is the core building block of Playwright tests
    it take two arguments, 1) description 2)async callback function
        1) description: Describes whatthe  test is checking. it must be String
        2) async callback function: takes fixture(s) and contains the codes of the test
        test('test name',async({fixtureName})) => {//test Cods};
page: is a fixture == driver (in selenium); we control a tab on our browser by using this fixture
      every test isolated page instance, one tab for every single test function
      provides loads of methods for navigation, interaction and assertions

      page methods: goto(url), title(), url(), setViewportSize({w,l}), page.locator(selecotr)
--------------------------------------------------------
locator(): a function that allows us to select elements on the page
    Action Methods: 
        click(), fill(), type(), press(). check(), uncheck(), selectOption()
    Retreival Methods:
        textContent(), innerText(), inputValue(), getAttribute(), waitForSelector()
    State Methods: 
        isVisible(), isHidden(), isEnabled(), isDisabled(), isChecked(), isSelected()
--------------------------------------------------------
We need to create a test function for each test case:
    we need to test function from playwright test library which contains the test cases and assertions
    const {nameOfTheFunctionToBeImported} = require ("libraryName");
    const {test} = require("@playwright/test");
--------------------------------------------------------
Test Groups:
    we use test.describe() to group tests together, allowing us to organize tests into logical groups
    Test groups can have their own hooks that apply to all tests in the group, before and after each test
Hooks functions: 
    Allow us to execute code before and after each test in a group
    ---------------------------------------------------
Promises: Futre Value/Errors (now/future/never)
    Promises in JavaScript can help handle async operations and they are object that present the ecentual completion (or faliure) of an async operation and its resulting value;
    A Promise in JS has 3 states:
        Pending
        Fulfilled
        Rejected
    Promises wait for operation to finish;
await: is a keyword used inside async function to wait for a promise
    It will pause the function untill the promise is resolved or rejected.
Synchronous vs Asynchronous:
    Synchronous: Tasks run one after another. Each step waits for the previous one to finish.
    Asynchronous: Tasks can run in parallel. The program keeps going while waiting for slower operations to complete. async and await are used here to manage those tasks efficiently.

--------------------------------------------------------
Assertions:
    Assertions in Playwright are used to validate the expected behavior of the application.
    Playwright provides built-in assertions and also allows us to write our own custom assertions.
    Assertions Methods woth with Value (no need for promise (no need for await )): 
        expect(actual).toBe(expected), expect(actual).toBeTruthy(), expect(actual).toBeFalsy(), expect(actual).toBeLessThan(expected), expect(actual).toBeGreaterThan(expected), expect(actual).toBeLessOrEqual(expected), expect(actual).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(expected), expect(actual).toContain(substring), expect(actual).toEqual(expected)
    Assertions Methods with locator/page (return promise need for await):  
    expect(locator/page).toBeVisible(), expect(expect(locator/page).toBe).toBeHidden(), expect(expect(locator/page).toBe).toBeEnabled(), expect(expect(locator/page).toBe).toBeDisabled(), expect(expect(locator/page).toBe).toHaveText(expected), expect(locator/page).toBeEmpty(), expect(locator/page).toContainText(expected), expect(locator/page).toHaveAttribute(name, value), expect(locator/page).toHaveCSS(cssSelector, expected)
--------------------------------------------------------
Alerts:
    Browser dialos that interrupt user interaction.
    Common types:
        confirmation, diaologs and prompt.
    To Handle alerts:
        We use on() method of the page object and it need to be called before the alert is triggered.
        methods:
            accpet(); dismiss();accept(input);
iFrame:
    Is an HTML element that embed another HTML document within the current document.
    Allows to display content from a different source.
    frameLocator() method of the page object is used for locating the iframes.
    The iframes can be located by using:
        ID, Name, CSS, XPATH: ex: let iframe1 = page.iframeLocator('#iframeID)
