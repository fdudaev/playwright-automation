Recommended VS Code Extrensions: 
    Code Runner (.run); JavaScript (ES6) code snipets; Prettier - Code formatter; Material Icon Theme; NPM; npmIntellisense; NPM Run; Playwright Test for SV Code; Playwright Sniipets; Playwright Test Snippets; CuCumber Gherkin; Better Coments; Tabnine;
Playwright @Playwright/test package:  designed specifically for end-toend testing
    Uses a specialized test runner and framwork, no need for junit/testNJ etc
Comes with buildin report
Fixtures: are set of variables that reffer to the specific type of objects (ex: in selenium we have "driver" in Playwright we have "page")
Fixtures: for (UI) page; browser; context; viewport; browserName; (API) request; baseURL..
Has its own global configuration
it includes built-in assertions
API testing

test (); // the test is the core building block of Playwright tests
    it take two arguments, 1) description 2)async callback function
        1) description: Describes whatthe  test is checking. it must be String
        2) async callback function: takes fixture(s) and contains the codes of the test
        test('test name',async({fixtureName})) => {//test Cods};
page: is a fixture == driver (in selenium); we control a tab on our browser by using this fixture
      every test isolated page instance, one tab for every single test function
      provides loads of methods for navigation, interaction and assertions

      page methods: goto(url), title(), url(), setViewportSize({w,l}), page.locator(selecotr)

locator(): a function that allows us to select elements on the page
    Action Methods: 
        click(), fill(), type(), press(). check(), uncheck(), selectOption()
    Retreival Methods:
        textContent(), innerText(), inputValue(), getAttribute(), waitForSelector()
    State Methods: 
        isVisible(), isHidden(), isEnabled(), isDisabled(), isChecked(), isSelected()


We need to create a test function for each test case:
    we need to test function from playwright test library which contains the test cases and assertions
    const {nameOfTheFunctionToBeImported} = require ("libraryName");
    const {test} = require("@playwright/test");

Test Groups:
    we use test.describe() to group tests together, allowing us to organize tests into logical groups
    Test groups can have their own hooks that apply to all tests in the group, before and after each test
Hooks functions: 
    Allow us to execute code before and after each test in a group
